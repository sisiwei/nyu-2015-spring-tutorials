Slides  
https://cdn.tig.as/files/20170222/20170222-nyu.pdf

Some links to tools (though slides also have lots of links)

* Password managers
  * _Don't use the same password everywhere! Sites get hacked all the time._
  * 1Password: https://agilebits.com/onepassword
  * LastPass: https://lastpass.com/
  * Dashlane: https://dashlane.com/
  * iCloud Keychain (in Mac and iOS, built into your Safari browser)
* Use two-factor authentication:
  * https://www.turnon2fa.com/tutorials/

*  Full disk encryption:
  * _Keeps data safe if your computer is turned off._
  * Windows BitLocker: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/bitlocker
  * Mac OS X FileVault: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790
    * How-to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9_ozRr_n8

* VPNs
  * _Helps secure your connection when you're on open wifi_
  * _Hides your actual IP address; site sees IP address of your VPN provider (see [this story](https://www.cyberscoop.com/new-york-times-journalist-exposed-ip-address-tipped-off-major-investigation/)_
  * NYU VPN
    * http://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/network-and-connectivity/vpn.html
  * Commercial options:
    * https://www.goldenfrog.com/vyprvpn
    * https://www.tunnelbear.com/
    * https://www.purevpn.com/

* Anonymized web browsing with Tor:
  * _Like VPNs, provides security and hides your IP address_
  * _Unlike VPNs, Tor distributes your traffic to volunteer-run relay computers, so no single organization sees all your traffic._
  * _Built-in censorship circumvention tools._
  * Downloads:
    * Tor Browser (PC/Mac): https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en
    * Onion Browser (iOS): https://mike.tig.as/onionbrowser/
    * Orbot+Orfox (Android), you need both pieces:
     * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android
     * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.orfox

Communicating with others!
  * _For each of these tools, your contact needs to have the tool too. (They need the part that decodes your message!)_
  * Easy: Encrypted phone calls & texts with [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/)
    * iPhone: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8
    * Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms
  * Kinda hard: Encrypted e-mail with PGP ("GPG")
    * [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) + [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/) (PC/Mac)
    * [GPG4Win](http://www.gpg4win.org/), for Windows + Outlook
    * [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org/), for Mac Mail app
    * [Mailvelope](https://www.mailvelope.com/en), a Chrome plugin that supports webmail. (Doesn't always work too well.)
